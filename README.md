# medical-prescription-recognition
# Overview
Medical Prescription Recognition is a machine learning-based project designed to digitize and interpret handwritten medical prescriptions accurately. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to enhance prescription legibility, thereby improving patient safety and reducing misinterpretation risks.
# Features
Converts handwritten prescriptions into digital text

Uses CNN for feature extraction and OCR for text recognition

Pre-processing techniques like noise reduction and image resizing

Supports various handwriting styles for improved accuracy

High precision and reliability in identifying medication names and dosages
# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: OpenCV, Pillow, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

Machine Learning Models: CNN, LSTM, RNN
